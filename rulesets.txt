📌 1. Balanced Growth (Classic "3D Life")
Rule: B6/S567
Interpretation:
Birth if a dead cell has 6 neighbors
Survive if a live cell has 5, 6, or 7 neighbors
Behavior: Produces stable structures, oscillators, and some complex emergent behavior. Considered the “3D analog” of Conway’s Life.
📌 2. Dense Survival Rules
Rule: B5/S4..8
Interpretation:
Birth with 5 neighbors
Survive with 4–8 neighbors
Behavior: Tends to produce dense, "coral-like" growths that spread through space without completely exploding.
📌 3. Sparse Expansion
Rule: B4/S45
Interpretation:
Birth with 4
Survive with 4 or 5
Behavior: Produces smaller, sparse structures that may stabilize or fizzle out quickly. Good if you want something "fragile" like in 2D Life.
📌 4. Chaotic / Explosive
Rule: B6..7/S6..10
Interpretation:
Birth with 6 or 7 neighbors
Survive with 6–10 neighbors
Behavior: Explodes into massive chaotic clouds, very "busy" automaton.
📌 5. "Life Without Death" in 3D
Rule: B5/S26 (or sometimes B4/S26)
Interpretation:
Cells can be born, but once alive they never die
Behavior: Growth never stops — it fills space with intricate crystal-like formations.

“B” means the number of neighbors for a dead cell to be born.
“S” means the number of neighbors for a live cell to survive.
